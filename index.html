    <H1>I am relearning HTML!</H1>
    <h />
    <H2>"Why relearning?" you ask.</H2>
    <p>"Because," I reply. "As an elder millennial I learned exactly enough HTML to be insufferable on LiveJournal dot com. I am delighted to resurrect my <marquee>valuable skills!"</marquee>
    </p>
    <h3>Some reasons I am pursuing a career change</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I do not wish for the whims of cranky brunchgoers to dictate my ability to feed myself.</li>
        <li>I never want to feel compelled to dress for work again.</li>
        <li>This seems like as good a skill set as any to acquire in the last few years of this dark experiment.</li>
    </ul>
